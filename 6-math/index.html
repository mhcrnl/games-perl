<a href="http://daniel.ruoso.com/categoria/perl/games-perl-5">5</A> on
the subject of writing games in Perl, now we are going to fix the math
in the game.</P>

<P>In the first post, I used a very naive simplification of the
movement calculation. I simply considered that the velocity was
constant during the time of the frame and recalculated the final
velocity after the frame so it would affect the next calculation.</P>

<P>I have to confess that I didn't do it just for the simplification
of the code. I did it because of my lack of good understanding of
math. Some people have noticed that I should've used
a <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge–Kutta_methods">Runge-Kutta</a>
method to solve the problem, but, honestly, the math language is
something that really requires a level of practice I simply don't have
(I've been working on Information Systems for 12 years, now it's the
first time I really miss calculus knowledge).</P>

<P>The problem I was trying to solve is: Considering I have a ball
that is falling at a speed of 3 m/s with a gravity of 9.8 m/s², how
far would it fall after 25 miliseconds (about 40 FPS). I'm strongly
visually-oriented, so let me try to represent in some ascii-art what I
was trying to find out.</P>

<PRE>
position | .
         |  I
         |   .
         |
         |    .
         |   
         |
         |     F
         |
         |
         |      .
         0-------------------------
          time
</PRE>

<P>I was considering I had defined the position I (initial) and I
wanted to know which was the position F (final).</P>

<P>It was only after I shared the problem with Edilson (a colleague
that works in the same place as I do), and after he present me a sheet
full of math calculations which I simply ignored, since I couldn't
understand, and then he said me: "You're looking at the wrong graphic,
this graphic is derived from another graphic, which is velocity vs
time".</P>

<P>This was a very important realization for me, bear with me: Let's
simplify the problem a bit, let's consider we have a constant
velocity. The graphic of velocity vs time would be something like:</P>

<PRE>
velocity |
         |
         |
         |
         |
         |
         |.......I..........F.....
         |
         |
         |
         |
         0-------------------------
          time
</PRE>

<P>You probably remember that in order to find out how much an object
moved in a given time-frame, the formula would be:</P>

<PRE>
     ΔS = Δt * v
</PRE>

<P>As I said before, I'm a very visually-oriented person, and at that
point I figured out the following:</P>

<PRE>
velocity |
         |
         |
         |
         |
         |
         |       I..........F     
         |       |          |
         |       |          |
         |       |          |
         |       |          |
         0-------------------------
          time
</PRE>

<P>Wait, that's a rectangle, its width is Δt and it's height is v,
so the distance travelled is the area of the rectangle.</P>

<P>WAIT! That's the definition of Integral I've been reading in math
books for a while and that never really meant anything to me because
of all the math blabbering that really require consistent math
practice to actually understand anything.</P>

<P>So now that I feel a lot less dumb, let's proceed to the problem at
hand. The velocity in our game is lineary-variable, which means that
its graphic over time will look like:</P>

<PRE>
velocity |                  .
         |                .
         |              .
         |            F
         |          .
         |        .
         |      .
         |    I
         |  .
         |.
         |
         0-------------------------
          time
</PRE>

<P>The intial grahic on the position over time at the beggining of
this post is derived from this graphic -- and this is actually the
meaning of derivative -- so the distance travelled in a given time
frame is the area of the trapezoid representing that time frame:</P>

<PRE>
velocity |
         |
         |
         |            F
         |          . |
         |        .   |
         |      .     |
         |    I       |
         |    |       |
         |    |       |
         |    |       |
         0-------------------------
          time
</PRE>

<P>So, the answer to my initial question is just a matter of
calculating that area:</P>

<PRE>
     Δs = ((vI + vF) * Δt)/2
</PRE>

<P>It looks pretty easy now, and, in fact, I feel quite dumb for
taking so long to realize that. But anyway, that is probably all the
required math for a lot of games. I hope I wasn't the only one who had
a hard time understading all that, and, anyway, now I can start to
understand more complex integral and derivative calculations.</P>

<P>So, let's apply that to the code in our game, which happens to be
at the Ball.pm file.</P>

<PRE>
sub time_lapse {
  my ($self, $old_time, $new_time) = @_;
  my $elapsed = ($new_time - $old_time)/1000; # convert to seconds...

  my $vf_h = $self->vel_h + $self->acc_h * $elapsed;
  my $vf_v = $self->vel_v + ($self->acc_v - g) * $elapsed;

  my $ds_h = (($self->vel_h + $vf_h) * $elapsed) / 2;
  my $ds_v = (($self->vel_v + $vf_v) * $elapsed) / 2;

  $self->vel_h($vf_h);
  $self->vel_v($vf_v);
  $self->cen_h($self->cen_h + $ds_h);
  $self->cen_v($self->cen_v + $ds_v);
}
</PRE>

<P>I also fixed the code in the main loop that was re-calculating that
instead of calling time_lapse.</P>

<PRE>
    foreach my $wall (@{$self->walls}) {
        if (my $coll = collide($ball, $wall, $frame_elapsed_time)) {
            # need to place the ball in the result after the bounce given
            # the time elapsed after the collision.
            $ball->time_lapse($oldtime, $oldtime + (($coll->time)*1000) - 1);

            if (defined $coll->axis &&
                $coll->axis eq 'x') {
                $ball->vel_h($ball->vel_h * -1);
            } elsif (defined $coll->axis &&
                     $coll->axis eq 'y') {
                $ball->vel_v($ball->vel_v * -1);
            } elsif (defined $coll->axis &&
                     ref $coll->axis eq 'ARRAY') {
                my ($xv, $yv) = @{$coll->bounce_vector};
                $ball->vel_h($xv);
                $ball->vel_v($yv);
            } else {
                warn 'BAD BALL!';
                $ball->vel_h($ball->vel_h * -1);
                $ball->vel_v($ball->vel_v * -1);
            }
            return $self->handle_frame($oldtime + ($coll->time*1000), $now);
        }
    }
</PRE>

<P>I'm not going to post any video for this post, since there's no
visual difference. But I hope the ascii-art graphics are good enough.</P>
