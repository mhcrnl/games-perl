on the subject of writing games in Perl, now we are going to add
a camera.</P>

<P>Up to this point, we've been coupling the positional information in
our simulated universe with the screen position. This is very easy to
do, but very limiting as well, how can we represent off-screen
elements that way?</P>

<P>Our next step is to implement a camera. The idea is quite simple,
instead of asking for each model object to render itself, We're going
to:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Initialize a view object for each of the model objects.</LI>
<LI>Detect which model objects are in the current view sight of the
camera.</LI>
<LI>Send to the view objects the positional information of the model
objects.
<LI>Ask the view objects to draw themselves.
</OL>

<P>At this point you might have noticed that I'm using the terms
"model" and "view" as a direct reference to the Model-View-Controller
architecture, and that's precisely my intention. The basic idea is:
The model is only responsible for managing the simulation of our
universe, while the view is only responsible for turning that
simulation visible to the user. The Controller here is the code that
implements the main loop, receiving the user events, and coordinating
the FPS management.</P>

<P>I could list several reasons on why having the model and the view
as separated objects is a good idea, but I'd like two point just two
of them, since these are going to be future topics in this
tutorial:</P>

<OL>
<LI>You can apply "themes" to the visualization, like "hi-res" and
"low-res" simply by changing the initialization of the view, adding
support for zoom and rotation is also very simple.
